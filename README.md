# Caliburn Bindable AppBar

This is a small extension to Caliburn Micro (until it's in Caliburn.Micro proper? :)) 
that adds a bindable appbar, with full support for Pivot- and Panorama-conducted views.

Licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

## Changelog

* 2.0.0
    - **REMOVED** support for Windows Phone 7 (use 1.x versions instead)
    - Update to support Caliburn.Micro 2.0 (thanks @jagui)
    - Changed `BackgroundColor`, `ForegroundColor`, `BarOpacity`, and `IsMenuEnabled` to DependencyProperties (thanks @belyansky)
    - Allow syncing appbar in hardcoded Panorama (thanks @matopeto)

* 1.0.5
	- Fix issue with background/foreground color (#13)
	- Fix sample WP80 issue with pivot and navigation (#9)
	- Update to Caliburn.Micro 1.5.2
	- Fix exceptions being thrown in design-time

* 1.0.4
	- Support PhoneApplicationPage as Pivot items (#8) 
	- Add `Invalidated` event to make handling theming easier
	
* 1.0.3
	- Check if parent is null before invalidating appbar (#3)
	
* 1.0.2
	- Fix issue with WP8 when using swappable bars + Pivot

* 1.0.1
	- Fix issue with swappable bars

* 1.0.0
	- Initial release

## Features

* `BindableAppBar`, `BindableAppBarButton`, and `BindableAppBarMenuItem` 
  are all full `DependencyObjects` so they can support full binding capabilities
* Full Caliburn message functionality (`cal:Message.Attach`)
* Bind icons
* Bind text
* Bind bar, button, and menu item visibility
* Support for automatic `Click` convention
* "Hot Swappable" app bars (multiple appbars per view with visibility bindings)
* `AppBarConductor` fully syncs with Panorama and Pivot controls, so you can have multiple appbar configurations

## Known Issues

* The Panorama control aborts transitions when you change the ApplicationBar's visibility (`null`, `Opacity = 0`, etc.)
  so to workaround it, there's a small background sleep of a configurable wait time (`PanoramaWaitThreshold`)

* Panorama is weird on Windows Phone 8 and the BAB doesn't play nice with it.

## Installation

Install via Nuget (also will install Caliburn.Micro):

	PM> Install-Package Caliburn.Micro.BindableAppBar

Once installed, you can wireup the default `Click` convention in your bootstrapper:

	static void AddCustomConventions()
    {

        // App Bar Conventions
        ConventionManager.AddElementConvention<BindableAppBarButton>(
            Control.IsEnabledProperty, "DataContext", "Click");
        ConventionManager.AddElementConvention<BindableAppBarMenuItem>(
            Control.IsEnabledProperty, "DataContext", "Click");

		// ... the rest of your conventions
	}

## Usage

### Single View

If you only need to bind an appbar on one page, it's very straightforward:

    <bab:BindableAppBar x:Name="AppBar">
        <bab:BindableAppBarButton
            x:Name="Add"
            Text="{Binding AddButtonText}"
            Visibility="{Binding ShowAddButton, Converter={StaticResource BooleanToVisibilityConverter}}"
            IconUri="{Binding ButtonIconUri}"/>
            
        <bab:BindableAppBarMenuItem
            x:Name="Pin"
            Text="{Binding PinItemText}" />
    </bab:BindableAppBar>

### Conducted Page

This is where things get interesting. Often times, you have a conductor with multiple pages.
It's simple to wireup your conductor to the appbar:

    public class SampleConductorBase : Conductor<Screen>.Collection.OneActive {

        public SampleConductorBase() {
                  
        }

        protected override void OnInitialize() {
            base.OnInitialize();
                                 
            Items.Add(new Item1ViewModel());
            Items.Add(new Item2ViewModel() { ShowAppBar = true });
            Items.Add(new Item2ViewModel());

            ActivateItem(Items[0]);

            // Initialize appbar, the views have been attached by this point
            AppBarConductor.Mixin(this);
        }        
    }

There are a few requirements:

1. Your conducted page must contain a `Pivot` or `Panorama` control
2. When you attach the `AppBarConductor`, it is after you have initialized the default items	

You can adjust the `Panorama` animation wait threshold easily:

	AppBarConductor.Mixin(this, panoramaWaitThreshold: 1000);
